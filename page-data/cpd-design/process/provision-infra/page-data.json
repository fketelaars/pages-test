If the state file is lost or corrupted, updates to the infrastructure will have to be done manually. The Ansible tasks have been built in a way that the Terraform state file is always persisted into the vault, even if the apply or destroy process has failed.\n\nThere are 3 main steps:\n\n#### Terraform init\nThis step initializes the Terraform provider (ibm) with the correct version. If needed, the Terraform modules for the provider are downloaded or updated.\n\n#### Terraform plan\nApplying changes to the infrastructure using Terraform based on the input configuration files may cause critical components to be replaced (destroyed and recreated). The plan step checks **what** will be changed. If infrastructure components are destroyed and the `--confirm-destroy` parameter has not be specified for the deployer, the process is aborted.\n\n#### Terraform apply or Terraform destroy\nThis is the execution of the plan and will provision new infrastructure (apply) or destroy everything (destroy).\n\nWhile the Terraform apply or destroy process is running, a `.tfstate` file is updated on disk. When the command completes, the deployer writes this as a secret to the vault so it can be used next time to update (or destroy) the infrastructure components.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"a22eb64a2aa6272066d8106083125549","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":228},"frontmatter":{"title":"Provision infrastructure","tabs":["Overview","Validate","Prepare","Provision-infra","Configure-infra","Install-cloud-pak","Configure-cloud-pak","Deploy-assets","Smoke-tests"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Provision infrastructure\ntabs: ['Overview', 'Validate', 'Prepare', 'Provision-infra', 'Configure-infra', 'Install-cloud-pak', 'Configure-cloud-pak', 'Deploy-assets', 'Smoke-tests']\n---\n\n# Provision infrastructure\n\nThis stage will provision the infrastructure that was defined in the input configuration files.
